environmental DNA biodiversity study on marine fish in MST samples

This repository holds several bash files for analysing next generation sequencing (NGS) data obtained from metabarcoding of marine environmental DNA samples collected by the Danish Environmenmtal Agency (Danish: Milj√∏styrelsen, abbreviated: MST). Part01 to part07 requires the raw  NGS data, which are stored on a remote server. Part01 to part07 have been set up to only be able to run externally on the University of Copenhagen High Perfromance Computing server. Part08 is an R code that should be able to run locally, and analyse the output from part07 and produce diagrams and plots
